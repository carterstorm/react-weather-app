# React weather app

This is one of the first applications I wrote to practice downloading data from the API, displaying it and error handling. The application allows you to search for weather in any city in the world. After searching for a city, you can add it to your favorites, which will appear above the input field.

The application is not finished, but it allowed me to practice some skills.

Unfortunately, I prepared the website only in Polish language.

There is no demo link for this project.
